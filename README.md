# Checklist

As a developer one of the things that I like is to have a process. Processes are good because they do define a clear path of what should be done in order to achieve a given goal.

Nowadays we use processes for almost everything and some of these are pretty know as the Agile + Scrum process therefore it doesn't cover all.

On this repository I have added a few checklists that will cover
- development of features and bugs
- critical issue handling
- emergency issue handling

The idea is to have, just as the name say, a checklist for safe-guard and improving quality. A checklist, as described on the checklist manifest (great book), decreased the error level on surgeries and as software engineers we are in the process of doing a small complex set of actions that can be seen as surgery in the daily basis.
